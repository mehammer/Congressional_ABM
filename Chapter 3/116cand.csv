5,Robert Good,"a self-described ''biblical conservative'' who tied himself closely to President Trump, maintained Republicans' hold on Virginia's largest House district early Wednesday, The victory was welcome news for Republicans, who had feared they could lose the seat after Mr. Good, a far-right conservative who struggled to raise money, defeated Representative Denver Riggleman in a bitter primary this summer. It demonstrated the party's continued support in rural America, even in states like Virginia where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. ran an unabashedly conservative campaign appealing to the rural heart of the sprawling district, which stretches from the outskirts of Washington, through the liberal university town of Charlottesville, to the far southern reaches of the state. He pledged to fight for ''Judeo-Christian'' values in Washington and defend the district from what he said was encroaching socialism and radicals like the Black Lives Matter movement. He tried to tie Dr. Webb, who is Black, to both, falsely charging that he supported defunding the police and insinuating that he would advocate a government takeover of the health care system. One ad superimposed Dr. Webb's face over menacing images of fires and confrontations with police and urged voters to ''look past the smooth presentation.'' Democrats denounced it as a ''racist dog whistle.'' Dr. Webb, whose father was a police officer, never supported defunding the police. praised attendees of a pro-Trump march in Washington, D.C. Saturday for not wearing masks amid what he called a ""phony"" coronavirus pandemic. spoke to the crowd while wearing a ""Trump 2020"" campaign hat and said the coronavirus crisis does not amount to a pandemic. The soon-to-be lawmaker's remarks come just days after Johns Hopkins marked the deadliest day yet of the pandemic and a total of 300,000 dead from COVID-19 across the country. The maskless Good shook hands with the man who introduced him and addressed the ""Stop the Steal"" rallygoers Saturday afternoon. ""I can't tell you how great it is to look out there and see your faces. This looks like a group of people that get that this is a phony pandemic,"" Good said, as several attendees offered raucous applause. ""It's a serious virus, but it's a virus, it's not a pandemic. It's great to see your faces, you get it. You stand up against tyranny. Thank you for being here today, thank you for saying 'no' to the insanity,"" the congressman-elect continued, speaking at the Freedom Plaza event.say that the people of the 5th Congressional District in Virginia elected him to ""stand up for the constitution"" when he assumes office next month. repeatedly touted Trump's economic policy during his campaign and said he supports the president's agenda entirely. ""This was a victory for true conservative principles at the end of the day,"" Good said at his victory party at Liberty University, the evangelical Christian college in Lynchburg, Virginia, last month. ""This will be a victory for the nation's founding Judeo-Christian principles. And this will be a victory for religious liberty, and the importance of faith and family."" was one of the featured speakers at a march for Trump organized by the group Women for America First, in support of his efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election. The rallies included musical performances and also a bizarre religious event featuring Catholic priests, Alex Jones and a messianic Jewish rabbi who bellowed personal visions he had of the apocalypse. “This will be a victory for true conservative principles. This will be a victory for the nation’s founding Judeo-Christian principles. And this will be a victory for religious liberty and the unashamed importance of faith and family accusing Riggleman in an interview with The Hill of having ""betrayed"" the trust of the conservative Republican base of his Virginia district, which includes Charlottesville and Danville. He opposes same-sex marriage and abortion without exceptions, while Riggleman sees same-sex marriage as an issue of individual liberty and supports some exceptions to bans on abortion. An immigration hardliner, Good wants to end birthright citizenship and make English the official national language to ""stop accommodating immigrants and their native tongues, because it's our unity that's our strength,"" according to The Roanoke Times.",R,0
1,Qasim Rashid,"campaign released a 30 second television ad titled Homework  The ad highlights the greatest issue facing Virginia First Congressional District, lack of reliable broadband internet access majority of essential workers are women, people of color, and immigrants. Our society would be unable to function without them Says Rashid STAFFORD Today Qasim Rashid, Democratic nominee for Congress in Virginia First District rolls out the Compassion for Working Families Plan. This plan centers the unique needs of working families and essential workers during this pandemic Our teachers, eldercare givers, nurses, hospital workers, grocery store workers, meatpacking workers, and warehouse workers are getting us through this difficult time writes The majority of essential workers are women, people of color, and immigrants. Our society would be unable to function without them and we need elected leaders who understand the realities they face and are willing to protect their safety and economic security.  When working families win, we all win here rolls out his Compassion for Veterans Plan. ;Military service has changed over the last fifty years. Ongoing combat operations lasting almost 20 years and multiple deployments of both Active Duty and Reserve Component personnel have created a group of American military veterans with unique support needs. More than 780,000 of these veterans live in Virginia, and more than 100,000 in the First District alone. These heroes deserve security in their lives, and it time to make sure each and every one has the health care, housing, and education resources they earned. My brother defended our country for five years as a United States Marine. His service makes this policy proposal personal to me and to my family. The First District is home to over 100,000 veterans and when I...7;m in Congress I fight for every single one of them. Here in Stafford, many of my neighbors and friends are members of our vibrant veteran and military family community. I’m proud of our campaign as a whole, but I’m especially proud of our veterans committee, who led the development of this Veterans proposal. Our veterans have sacrificed immensely for our nation and when elected I will deliver for these heroes  On top of the health and economic effects of the coronavirus crisis, folks in Virginia are struggling with quality of life. We need access to quality health care, access to high-speed broadband internet. We need to address increasing income inequality, fix the lack of a living wage and ensure truly equal protection under the law. We also must take emergency action to address the existential threat of climate change. These three issues all are interrelated, but if we tackle broadband, then everything else gets easier to fix. If you have money and you live in the right place, you have high-speed internet. You might even be able to work from home or see your health care provider via video chat. But many working people don't have the access to these opportunities. Broadband is foundational to economic opportunity in the 21st century  COVID-19 has accelerated challenges for families across the commonwealth. How would you grade Congress' work in helping Americans get through the pandemic? Identify some successes and failures. Congress took some steps in the right direction, such as extending unemployment benefits, but then those benefits were allowed to expire too early. That's sort of a microcosm for how this whole thing has gone. Congress hasn't done enough for small businesses, particularly in the service industry. Additionally, Congress has yet to get serious about closing the digital divide, which would, among its many benefits, make an easier task of finding remote employment. In short, Congress can do a lot better for working families struggling to get through this crisis. With two-year terms and never-ending campaign cycles, members of the Virginia delegation are fortunate to be based near Washington, D.C. How would you budget time spent in D.C. versus home? Members of the Virginia delegation certainly are fortunate! Since the 1st District is within driving distance to Washington, I'd be able to come home to my family every night. I have young kids and spending time with them means everything to me. This proximity to D.C. also means I can spend more time in the district talking to voters about their concerns I'm proud of my campaign's commitment to accessibility and I plan to continue to stay extremely connected to this district when elected. That is a key difference between my opponent and me. Whoever wins in November would drive back and forth to D.C., but because I spent more time listening to folks in the 1st District than my opponent does, I believe I can best advocate for their needs in Washington. I stand with Del. Josh Cole, D-Stafford, and the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus in Richmond. This would not be in my purview when holding federal office, but here's the way I analyze the situation. Everybody wants reform on this issue. Everybody believes that voters should choose their elected officials, and that elected officials should not have the power to choose their voters. However, the gerrymandering amendment as it currently exists is insufficient. Why even bother with dialogue? The ""other side"" clearly only cares about themselves. It makes more sense to gather our base, vote them out and undo the damage they've done. Right? It's hard to ignore this argument precisely because it feels so good to stick it to those who've treated us so unjustly, mocked and ridiculed us, and in some cases, even denied us our humanity. I can't argue against the human instinct for self-preservation. We all have an ego and this piece isn't about crushing your ego and singing kumbaya and feeling good. ""F**k your feelings,"" as I've seen on a shirt, or two, these past four or five years.  But here's an idea. What if we looked at this question about dialogue from a different perspective - one that genuinely speaks to the goal of gathering our base, voting ""them"" out and undoing the damage done? What if we approach dialogue vs self-preservation not as divergent paths, but the convergent path we need to follow to heal this divided nation and undo the damage done? I've learned in my years as a human rights lawyer that on issues of economic justice, health care and basic human decency, it isn't a left-versus-right issue, but a human dignity issue that necessitates we work together. Abraham Lincoln once warned, ""America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves."" With record highs in hate crimes, record lows in trust in the government and media, and record wealth and income inequality - we're facing the consequences of self-imposed self-destruction. Add to that an economic crisis, hundreds of thousands dead from a pandemic and rates of depression at frightening highs, one thing is for sure: The current model isn't working. But another model will work - one that recognizes the convergent path of dialogue and undoing the damage done by the ""other"" side. For starters, let's remember that many of the major things we're supposed to disagree with each other about - like health care, education, the environment, and even firearm legislation - are manufactured disagreements. Sounds surprising, but it shouldn't be. In truth, the vast majority of Americans agree on the need for comprehensive and high-quality, affordable health care. The question then isn't whether we want health care, but what should that health care look like? Again, the vast majority of Americans, nearly 70%, agree that health care is a human right and we deserve universal ""Medicare for All."" And this overwhelming agreement isn't just isolated to health care Take education and cancelling student loan debt. Americans across the board recognize the need to rein in the cost of higher education. Nearly 60% of Americans support free four-year public college. Moreover, 67% of Americans, including 58% of Republicans, support the widespread cancellation of debt. Only 26% of Americans oppose such measures. And we can't mention education without the need to basic access via broadband internet - especially during a pandemic. But while Americans overwhelmingly want to treat the internet as an accessible utility for all, we're beholden to major corporations who instead are more worried about making a profit than they are about ensuring our kids can learn, our sick can access medicine and telehealth, our rural small businesses can access the marketplace, or our farmers can secure the data they need for a successful crop. And what about the Green New Deal, the allegedly socialist, left-wing pipe dream? Well, it turns out Americans love the outdoors and want to preserve our environment while protecting our economic security. Unsurprisingly, nearly 60% of Americans support the Green New Deal's initiatives to do just that and only 22% oppose. But let's look at something really controversial - firearms. Contrary to the common assumptions, the data shows that Americans overwhelmingly agree on firearm safety, with 64% wanting stricter legislation compared to only 7% who oppose it. An astounding 83% of Americans want to pass universal background checks on all gun sales. Again, on these issues that matter most to Americans, there is large agreement. This begs the question: Given the overwhelming support for these policies from Americans across the political spectrum, why aren't these policies laws yet?  In short, because politicians and pundits have convinced us that we are divided. We've been fed the myth that no American from our party can do wrong and no American from the opposing party can do right. So we're convinced, sadly and too often, to vote against our own interests to perpetuate an us-versus-them mentality. To be sure, this doesn't mean we ignore the aforementioned substantive issues of spiking hate crimes or climate science denial. It means we recognize the source of these injustices aren't necessarily the vast majority of our fellow Americans. So why bother with dialogue? Because it helps us realize that our neighbors, co-workers and family members aren't necessarily the ones who oppose us. Instead, it's a limited few who cling to power and refuse to support the demands and needs of our overwhelming majority. The overwhelming national agreement on major issues like health care, education, climate justice and even firearm legislation are a framework for us to converge to secure the human dignity we deserve - united. Rashid believes healthcare is a human right"" and is a strong supporter of a single-payer healthcare system, according to his campaign website. On education, Rashid supports at least a 5 percent increase for teacher pay to address the vacancy problems Virginia schools are facing. ""It starts with three words: raise their salaries,"" Rashid said about the teacher shortage during an interview. ""Both my parents were educators and today I have two children in the Virginia public school system. I know how important it is to take action on this issue. Rashid also spoke on the issue of student loan debt. ""In America, we literally have more student loan debt than credit card debt,"" said Rashid. He was endorsed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who created a similar approach to combating student debt. ""I'm in wholehearted agreement with [Warren's] approach, which involves broad cancellation of student loan debt and also provides universal tuition-free public two- and four-year college and technical school,"" he said. Rashid supports restoring voter rights to felons that have served their time. In addition, he supports reforming the bail system to avoid keeping nonviolent offenders from staying in jail because they cannot post bail. Rashid also supports passing police reforms. ""My top priority would be the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. It contains numerous and sweeping reforms, all of which are urgently needed. Passing that law would make an incredible difference,"" he said. .""My conversations with student activists, both online and offline, inform my worldview and my political philosophy. I try to meet students and young people where they are, and I stay open to considering new ideas. Not too long ago, I was a student myself. I still have student loans. I'm the best candidate for students because I'm 100% committed to delivering for young people when I get to Congress,"" said Rashid.",D,0
2,Scott Taylor,"voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced taxes for businesses and individuals and raised the standard deduction. Because it was not supplemented with equivalent spending cuts, the bill also increased the deficit. has supported job training and retraining programs and a balanced budget amendment. The former representative also fell into controversy when he failed to pay his property taxes on time at least twice. is a critic of the Affordable Care Act and has called for its repeal, but he said those with pre-existing conditions should be able to purchase health insurance. He has supported replacing the Affordable Care Act and legislation that would increase competition by allowing people to purchase health insurance across state lines. has an A rating from the National Rifle Association and said he would oppose legislation that would restrict gun rights. He co-sponsored legislation that would establish a national standard for concealed carry, which would permit a person to carry a concealed firearm in any state if they have a concealed carry permit in one state and are not prohibited from carrying in another state under the federal law.

3,John Collick,"I never envisioned running for Congress, but in 2018, after finding that Congressman Bobby Scott is rarely opposed for re-election, I started looking for someone to support who could challenge him. After several months of looking for someone and reviewing Bobby Scott's record, I found nobody that could mount an effective campaign, so I decided to run. Bobby Scott may be a 14-term Congressman, but he's done absolutely nothing for the District that he represents; he literally believes he'll get votes simply because of his name. People want school choice, trade schools, and jobs - everything that Bobby Scott could have delivered to the District as the Chairman of the Education and Labor Committee in the House of Representatives, but didn't care enough to do it. Bobby Scott votes over 95% of the time with Nancy Pelosi, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Maxine Waters; none of these women could ever get elected in the 3rd District, so as voters find that Bobby Scott is aligned with all of them on nearly every issue, they'll start pulling their support from him and coming over to support John Collick for Congress. Red Flag Laws are wholly unconstitutional as they require police to confiscate guns from citizens based on a civil complaint, not because of criminal behavior. The text of the law implies guilt unless proven innocent by the aggrieved party; the exact opposite of what our Constitution states - innocent until proven guilty. I'll never support any legislation that requires an American to prove his/her innocence rather than requiring the government to prove guilt. This was done through regulation. I believe that when any agency creates a regulation, Congress must enact it as law within two calendar years or it's dissolved, and no other regulation that will have the same requirements or outcomes can be created again. What is your opinion on the National Firearms Act? The NFA is a taxing scheme to restrict firearm ownership. I am totally against this and believe it should be repealed. Any taxes paid on firearms or ammunition should not exceed the sales tax for the state and/or municipality that the sale occurs in. AmmoLand: Will you support national reciprocity? Yes, although I actually don't support the registration of guns or licensing of people. What restrictions should be on the Second Amendment? All rights come with responsibilities; therefore, when a citizen breaks the law, depending upon the crime, the state may restrict the right to own weapons from that person. I do agree with current laws that owners of crew-served automatic weapons should be licensed. Still, ownership should not necessarily be restricted - except that ONLY law-abiding citizens should ever be able to own them. Do you support mandatory mask laws? No. An executive order is being used to mandate that everyone wear masks; the governor has no such executive authority over the general populace - only when it applies to the executive branch of government. An executive mandating anything that the legislature has not passed into law is dictatorial in nature, which I will never support. What do you think of the national unrest? The current national unrest is being fomented by the Leftists of our society, who want to destroy our way of life. Several groups are getting donations through ActBlue, the Democratic Party donation platform. Governors and mayors of most of the cities being terrorized are supporting the criminals while undermining their own neighbors who happen to be police officers - to a point that each day, these cities (and other American cities) get less and less safe for the average American. is a NRA instructor and a constitutional activist. He is the former CEO of Veritas Firearms, LLC and is the co-host of The Patriot News Podcast has written extensively on the patriot movement including 3%'ers, Oath Keepers, and Militias. In addition to the Patriot movement, John has written about firearms, interviewed people of all walks of life, and on the Constitution. John lives in Northern Virginia with his wife and sons and is currently working on a book on leftist deplatforming Every American deserves the opportunity for a financially secure life. Education is the only way to achieve real opportunity in America. We must have vocational technical high schools to teach the trades to youth who may otherwise not graduate. I am most passionate about equal opportunity for everyone, not necessarily equal outcomes. The only way to offer equal opportunity is through education. Children must be able to receive a high quality education without regard to their ethnicity or economic status. Any child assigned to an unaccredited school, must have the right to choose the school they want to attend, even a private school. School choice will guarantee that schools compete for students, increasing the quality of education in their school districts. Furthermore, many students have no intention of attending college; many of them leave school before graduation. To get the graduation rate up and help students develop marketable skills in the trades, we need Vocational Technical high schools. More students will enjoy going to school; they'll be learning trades, knowing they will have marketable skills when they graduate, so most will stay in school until graduation and then be able to get good paying jobs. This will not only reduce poverty, but also reduce the number of young people becoming criminals. Integrity is most important. We live in a country where Americans expect candidates to lie so they can get elected; sometimes I think even when the lies are obvious, voters will ignore them as long as they hear what they want. Sadly, many Americans have historically voted for incumbents based on new promises, not previous successes. Honor is vital for anyone in positions of authority. If an incumbent (or challenger, for that matter) is asked for help because a candidate for another office assaulted that person - or committed any crime - it's imperative that the incumbent (or challenger) immediately report the allegation to law enforcement. This happened in this District and the incumbent did absolutely nothing because he wanted to ensure the accused won his election. The incumbent, Congressman Bobby Scott, puts politics over his personal honor.Justice is another important principle. Without justice, we cannot treat everyone fairly and impartially. Every American must always be treated with dignity and respect, even when accused of misdeeds. Otherwise, we'll have a populace that believes an accused person is guilty or innocent, based solely on their political ideology, not the facts. I have signed a pledge to co-sponsor legislation to enact term limits for both houses of Congress. Our greatest challenge is to return to being Americans first with party affiliation being secondary. It seems that no matter the issue, as soon as one politician makes a statement about that issue, the other party will immediately reject any support as wrong. The opposition party to the President always seems to fight anything he proposes, even when they have previously proposed the exact same thing",R,0
4,Leon Benjamin,"The top issues that I'll be fighting for in the 4th Congressional District are educational opportunities, fostering economic growth, supporting a safe public environment and supporting recovery for the U.S. from the COVID-19 pandemic. I would give Congress a C+ on its work handling the pandemic. At the start, the CARES Act was a strong package that provided direct relief to American industry and the American people.  However, since then the Democrats passed the HEROES Act that is full of wasted spending and horrible policy. Since they passed that bill, they have stalled every negotiation attempt. That's not what the American people need or want. People are policy, and my main focus would be on spending time in the district listening to the needs of my constituents. In central Virginia, we are fortunate to be close to our capital and I would not neglect that privilege. When I am needed in Washington, I will be there; all other times I plan to be in my district.I will be voting ""yes"" on Amendment 1. Whether Democrats or Republicans are in power, a fair and honest assessment of the districts is needed. I support a nonpartisan board that is appointed on merit, not the whims of the party in power. Benjamin, 52, is a South Richmond pastor who calls himself a special adviser to Trump and leads a prayer group for the president each week. He planned to attend Trump's campaign stop at the Newport News airport on Friday night. ""I believe in what he is doing,"" he said of the president in an interview. Benjamin is comfortable with the political spotlight. He appeared with Vice President Mike Pence in a political rally for McAdams in Richmond two years ago and has courted Trump supporters with appearances on Fox News as a conservative, pro-life Black Republican who embraces the president's policies.  ""We're gaining a lot of momentum,"" he said. Some Republican candidates are trying to avoid outright opposition to the ACA because of its popular protection of people with pre-existing health conditions, but Benjamin said he considers the law a failure. ""The ACA has not been what people thought it would be,"" he said. Benjamin said Trump deserves credit rather than blame for the handling of the pandemic.  ""What the president has done is kept the panic down,"" he said, echoing Trump's defense in the book. Benjamin would rather talk about the protests that ignited in Richmond and across the country over racial injustice after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in late May. Like Trump, he contends that ""radical elements"" had taken control of legitimate protests that resulted in violence and looting. He also faulted Gov. Ralph Northam and Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, both Democrats, for their handling of the protests.  ""They should have stopped it on day one and supported our police,"" he said, adding that the idea of ""defunding police"" would make poor, Black neighborhoods more vulnerable to crime Instead, Benjamin tried to frame the question with an appeal to law and order. ""Safety is so important right now, and then our education, and then our health care,"" he said. Benjamin talked about public safety, supporting police and preserving individual liberties against government overreach. Benjamin, 52, is senior pastor and bishop of New Life Harvest Church in South Richmond. He appears regularly on Fox News and other conservative political television shows as an anti-abortion minister who strongly supports the president. He finished second in a four-way race for the 9th District seat on Richmond City Council in 2017.Both candidates have been happy to make the campaign about Trump and Benjamin's support for the president. During the forum, they clashed on a potential vaccine for COVID-19. Benjamin declined to make it mandatory for people to take and McEachin vowed to encourage people to take a vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration, while trying to tie the issue to Trump. ""We need a vaccine, but a vaccine that people can have faith in, not one touted by a desperate president trying to win votes instead of saving lives,"" McEachin said in his opening remarks. The candidates, both African Americans running in a district that is ""minority influenced,"" also differed along party lines on hot button issues such as immigration, gun control, systemic racism and raising the minimum wage. Benjamin said he could support an increase in the minimum wage, but when pressed to say how much, he said he would leave the amount ""up to the employer."" McEachin also didn't name an amount, but said the increase in the minimum wage should ""depend on where you live."" While Benjamin tried to cast McEachin as inattentive and ""missing in action,"" the congressman derided his challenger as ""someone who really doesn't know what he's talking about, versus someone who've been there and who's delivered for you all these years."" As a Gulf War Veteran, service to God and Country go hand in hand. Our Constitution must be protected from foreign and domestic enemies Governments main role is to protect the Rights of the People which come from God and not Government. When the People fear the Government tyranny is present, but when the Government fears the People their is Liberty. We as American Citizens deserve the highest and best education that can be provided. School Choice along with grant base incentives can provide more options for failing locals, give residents an escape from poor performing schools and create an environment for positive competition for locals that want to improve their performance. Economic Development Our region is prime for Economic Renewal through Opportunity Zone Projects. Full scale Redeveloment Projects that afford these zones to create affordable housing, launch thousands of new jobs, implement certification programs and support small business launches are just what our 4th Congressional District need. We must address the main topics within our health policy: Mental health stigma and funding, Minority and Latino Health opportunities, and Defending the 2nd Amendment as necessary to curtail Violence and Criminal activity within our neighborhoods. Other issues related to health care for all, such as providing an Alternative to the Affordable Care Act, exposing the downfall of initiating Medicare for all, and giving women more options to creating a healthy family as to not having to end the life of the unborn. Virginia has much to offer when it comes to educational programs that will help individuals get into Science and Technology Industries. Our goal is to create programs Through Virginia Educational Workforce Consortiums. The characteristics that are most important for an elected official are to be an affective listener. An affective listener will be more problem solving conscious than presumptuous minded, thinking he or she knows best as to wanting to know what their constituency thinks. Another characteristic is to be a servant leader. A servant leader is able to put oneself last so that others can be placed first. Lastly, one more characteristic is to be open to criticism and to accept correction when necessary. No one knows it all and the ability to remain teachable is so very important to being an effective representative. Some of the challenges America will face over the next decade are : how we defend the Constitution and the 1st and 2nd Amendment Rights for all law abiding citizens, how we address our immigration policies to make sure we are keeping America safe and America first, making sure we are tackling the debt clock by curtailing our spending patterns and looking where we can limit government over reach, making sure that all families have access to quality health care with the high cost to sustain our programs and looking to how we can continually find ways to lower and cut taxes for our Citizens, while increasing the tax base for small businesses and emphasizing products and services that produce jobs and entrepreneurship and lastly we must make sure voter integrity is kept on all levels of our political processes.",R,0
5,Bryant Webb,"This is one of those moments where Virginia is standing up and speaking out, and we’re ready to go in a different direction — one focused on unity, inclusion and making sure everyone has opportunities to succeed,” Dr. Webb said in a telephone interview late Tuesday night. It was also not lost on Dr. Webb that life has in recent months been upended by a pair of crises with which he is personally familiar: a viral pandemic and nationwide unrest over police brutality, systemic racism and inequality. “You can’t pick your moments,” he said. “I’m glad to be in a spot where I can do some good What people often lose sight of is that in the 5th Congressional district, the largest employer is the health care sector....When these hospitals close, it reverberates. It's not just a loss of health care access, it's a loss of economic resources, it's a loss of jobs, the loss of a lifeblood for a community,""said Dr. Cameron Webb, candidate for Virginia's 5th Congressional District. ""I'm on the Medicaid board in Virginia, and we are all proud of the Medicaid expansion and the nearly 470,000 Virginians who got coverage, but I want to put it in context of this pandemic. Because during COVID, when people are losing jobs, when employers aren't able to provide coverage for lots of reasons, 136,000 Virginians gained coverage through Medicaid. Without it, they would have been in a really tough spot. All of which will be implemented and led with the lens of racial equity I remember prior to coming back to the University of Virginia, when I was working in the White House, I remember the deep admiration I had for Vice President Biden. And, as you mentioned, yes, I worked on the White House health care team. I worked closely with a lot of the team as we were implementing and executing the Affordable Care Act said Dr. Cameron Webb, Fifth District Democratic Nominee I also worked on the My Brothers Keeper initiative. But I had the great fortune to work with some of Vice President Bidens team on the cancer moonshot What I saw was that Vice President Biden is not afraid of some of the tallest tasks facing our society Vice President Biden believes in an economy where every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. He believes in an economy where African American, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native American workers and families are finally welcomed as full participants in this economy. ""My true north is equity and justice - that's what my entire career has been built around,"" Webb said in an interview with The Cavalier Daily. advocates for affordable healthcare for all. He believes public health insurance should be an alternative available for anyone, with the option to still remain with private insurance. ""It's going to be important for folks to have both the public option and other private options available to decide what best meets their family's needs - that choice is important to a lot of Americans,"" Webb said. ""The goal is that no matter what ... it should be affordable."" Lowering prescription drug costs - an issue he worked on in the White House under President Donald Trump - is another priority for Webb, which would arise through intervention from Medicare and more thorough barriers against monopolizing behavior among drug companies. He foresees bringing more generic drugs to the market as another way to lower prices. ""We still want to make sure that we preserve innovation in our prescription drug space and I say that as a practicing physician, knowing that the development of medications has been both life prolonging and life saving for my patients,"" he said. The COVID-19 pandemic is at the forefront of issues representatives are expected to handle. Every week, Webb has hosted a weekly COVID-19 update livestream on his Facebook page, where he discusses latest updates and COVID-19-safe practices and answers questions from viewers. His platform has a three-layered approach for COVID-19 recovery that involves bolstering individuals, the healthcare system and businesses - particularly small businesses - throughout the crisis. For individuals, Webb advocates for direct stimulus payments and protection against eviction and student loan defaults, among other plans. Expanding on existing COVID-19 healthcare practices, he looks to increase testing, funding for hospitals and medical resources and contact tracing as methods to increase preparedness for a potential second wave of infections. Webb also supports increasing the amount of emergency loans offered to small businesses and introducing new policies to oversee responsible usage of funds by corporate entities On the education front, Webb looks to promote equity among students of diverse backgrounds. He specifically mentions low-income students and older adults without higher education as groups disadvantaged by existing barriers to obtaining a degree. One of the biggest ideas he pushes is making two-year colleges and public colleges and universities free for low-income individuals, which he envisions being implemented through reforms to the Higher Education Act and grants and subsidies. Related to lowering barriers to higher education is access to broadband, or high speed, internet - a significant factor in the digital divide among students. Webb deviates from opponent Bob Good's approach of incentivizing private internet companies in that he wants a public-private partnership where government funding plays a larger role in expanding broadband availability. In rural areas where broadband is particularly hard to come by, private companies would find it difficult and not cost effective to take the extra effort to make sure everyone gets covered, Webb says. This is where he believes federal funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture or Federal Communications Commission could support that effort, or through state intervention with the Virginia Telecommunication Initiative and local broadband initiatives. ""We all agree we need to have broadband access,"" Webb said. ""It's not a partisan issue. It's a matter of who can actually get to do the advocacy necessary to deliver on that."" Webb also addresses the issue of affordable housing and long lasting effects of redlining in Charlottesville, a topic he has explored in his own class with students called Place Matters. In order to make housing more accessible for lower income individuals, Webb stresses the importance of investing in first time homeownership through grants and incentives. ""The idea of homeownership is one that unlocks intergenerational wealth and stability,"" Webb said. ""By creating grants that are available for first time homebuyers ... it's the key to making sure that we're opening up opportunities for folks and navigating some of the existing dynamics."" Incentivizing builders to construct affordable homes is another method Webb hopes to implement to secure housing for lower income communities. Underlying much of Webb's platform is the idea of bridging the divide between different income brackets. A major step towards reaching this goal, he says, is raising the minimum wage to $15. Webb aims to steer the U.S. towards setting a standard of 100 percent clean energy, but he does not support the Green New Deal, which he calls ""aspirational."" He cites reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that call for a longer timeline to reach zero carbon emission by 2050. Manufacturing, construction and transportation are three areas on which Webb wants to concentrate on placing new standards. A mix of carbon pricing caps and trade policies, he says, would gradually dial back carbon emissions as the country prepares to take on clean renewable energy as the primary source of power. ""This is a job creator,"" Webb said, pointing out Charlottesville and Lynchburg as centers for clean energy. In the realm of gender equality, Webb supports the individual's right to choose abortion. Increased funding for Planned Parenthood and access to reproductive care continue his plan to establish women's bodily autonomy across the country. Webb promises to push for the passing of the Equal Rights Amendment across the country and to reenact the Violence Against Women Act along with new policies designed to protect sexual and ethnic minorities. Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA on Jan. 27. Webb acknowledges the work the International Rescue Center has done in Charlottesville to support refugees. ""Humane"" is the keyword he uses for the reform he wishes to enact in immigration policy. Ultimately, Webb wants to clear a fair pathway to citizenship for newcomers to the country. ""Yes, we want to have security at our southern border, and I'm not suggesting otherwise,"" Webb said. ""But I'm suggesting that that process has to look like our values as a nation - I think right now it's falling short of that.""",D,0
6,Nicholas Betts,"I believe healthcare should be viewed as a right and a public necessity. We are all safer and the country can be more prosperous when everyone has access to healthcare. Americans having access to higher education is crucial if we want to stay the world leader in innovation in the 21st century. We have a student loan debt crisis, with over 44 million borrowers who have $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. This stifles economic growth and is an impediment for many citizens seeking to further educate themselves. Higher Education must be made more affordable, and one way to do that is to make 0% interest rates permanent for student loans. If we make Higher Education more affordable and increase accessibility, America will be more prosperous as a country. We need to protect the environment. One way we can start is to encourage businesses to develop and utilize clean energy sources such as solar and wind energy. These are technologies that other countries are developing and we cannot afford to be left behind if we want to maintain our position as the world leader in the 21st century I am passionate about developing and implementing programs that help average, everyday, hard working Americans. Specific areas I'd like to focus on are: increasing access to healthcare, increasing access to affordable Higher Education, properly funding K-12 education, and making sure that all Americans have access to reliable high-speed internet connections. An elected official should be a good listener, have a very good understanding of the policies they are advocating for, and make sure those policies help their constituents and the American people. An elected official should be able to work with other elected officials with similar views as well as elected officials with different views if a reasonable and Constitutional compromise can be found. We need to find a way to work together to accomplish common goals that will benefit the American people.",D,0
7,Nicholas Freitas,"I always tell people when they ask me that, it's a little like asking me why I wanted to go to combat. There was a need, and I know that sounds a little bit clich, but I don't know how else to explain it. I never dreamed of being a U.S. Senator one day. I wanted to be a soldier, and that's what I did for most of my younger years. Eleven years active duty in the military. The reason why I think it's necessary right now in Virginia is that we have representation in the form of Tim Kaine, who clearly among other things opposes the Second Amendment. He brags about his F grade from the NRA, and it's not just about the Second Amendment. I never dreamed of being a U.S. Senator one day. I wanted to be a soldier, and that's what I did for most of my younger years. Eleven years active duty in the military. It's about what do you see as government's proper role and relationship with the people. For me, government exists to protect our liberty, to protect our property, and provide equal justice before the law. Among that is ensuring that the government understands that we have a right to be able to defend ourselves as free people. Tim Kaine clearly stands against a lot of that, and so he needs to go. You gave a truly impassioned gun-rights speech on the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates. I think it got 11 million hits on Facebook. What inspired you to give that speech?  Well, I actually sit on the subcommittee on militia, police and public safety in the General Assembly that handles all the gun legislation. So, for just weeks upon weeks, we have been hearing certain Democrat colleagues compare us to Nazis, comparing us to segregationist suggesting that if we didn't vote for their particular anti-Second Amendment bills than we wanted guns to fall in the hands of terrorists. I mean it was just one personal attack after the next. It was frustrating because these same people that were launching these personal attacks were then trying to lecture everybody on civil dialogue and reasonable legislation in order to protect our kids. I was fed up. I was absolutely fed up. There are so many things that we actually agree on that will actually protect our kids, like additional school resource officers, or trauma-informed education for first responders and teachers, or various ways that we can address the behavior, but unfortunately a small group, and I do believe that there's a much smaller group than the media sometimes suggest, they look at this tragedy as a way to exploit it in order to gut the Second Amendment. So, they're not interested in talking about all of the other things that we could be doing that we all agree on that are not controversial in order to protect our kids. Instead, they want to use this situation to really curtail our Second Amendment rights, and I was tired of it. So, I felt it was about time that we not only defend ourselves, but that we also point out some of the rampant hypocrisy and the accusations that were being thrown against us and try to refocus the debate on what we could agree on, and what we should be doing Instead of exploiting the tragedy. I was surprised by a couple of things. One, I was surprised by the reaction of the Democrats. They all requested a recess, and several of them started to walk out during the speech, and then the next week they gave speeches about how offended they were. For me, it was amazing that here they could watch as their colleagues compare us to Nazis and segregationist and we were just supposed to take it. The moment someone brought up that this was not civil dialogue, the moment someone brought up that maybe we should look at other data points besides the ones that they were concerned with, and when someone brought up the honest history of the Democratic Party, all of a sudden, they were grossly offended and just couldn't believe someone would do that. Well, again, if you're offended by the truth, maybe your problem is with the truth, not me, but as soon as it went online, it immediately took off. We first put it online because the media and others had just desperately tried to misrepresent what I had said. There was one headline and the Richmond Times dispatch that said, 'Delegate suggests abortion leads to mass shootings. 'Well, anybody that saw the speech could see what I was actually saying, but that's sort of misrepresentation was rampant early on. We wanted to counter that with what the actual speech was about. 40 million hits later we've just gotten an overwhelmingly positive response. What is your opinion on the National Firearms Act? My problem with all of this is that we keep focusing on the Second Amendment as if it's just about firearms, and really what it is ultimately about is your right to self-defense. Firearms are a key component of that. If you really look at it, firearms were the first thing that came about that allowed a weaker person to be able to defend themselves from a stronger opponent or a stronger attacker. Any sort of effort that we have which gives this false sense to society that by curtailing the rights of law-abiding citizens, we can somehow protect people, I think it's just a false narrative to start off with .Regardless of what the act is, regardless of what any of it is, I want to make sure that we're protecting people's right to defend themselves. Firearms are a critical aspect of that. I don't think there's any doubt that the Second Amendment conveys an individual right to keep and bear arms. So the quick answer for not only for this, but anything else the question is, 'Is this infringing on someone's Second Amendment rights? 'If it is, then I'm going to oppose it. If it's supporting law-abiding citizen's right to be able to defend themselves, then I'm going to support it.John: What motivated you to become a Green Beret? I always wanted to join the military from a pretty young age. In my family, my mother is a nurse. My father is a police officer, my grandparents were in the military, my great grandparents So, there's a line of service with law enforcement, medical field, the military, and part of me wanted to carry on that legacy. Then another part of me just felt that I have a lot of dedication to my country and not just the country but the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the philosophy which has made it possible. I want to do assume personal responsibility for its security. The military was a way I felt I could do that and I could contribute to that. Honestly, I loved it. I absolutely love being a Green Beret. I didn't join Special Forces until after 9/11. I was infantry before that, but I saw what Special Forces was able to accomplish and the sort of mission set that they were engaging in. That was something I wanted to be a part of : Sanctuary Cities have been in the news a lot lately. Would you support withholding federal funds from those cities? Yes.I think it's about time that we understand that there's a lot of things that the federal government is engaged in right now that I don't think are legitimate functions within the federal government, but border security and immigration policy is something that I think is legit. You have some of these communities now when you look at the welfare that we have in this country, and clearly, we need a lot of reform within that, but I think everyone agrees that those welfare programs and those support programs, at least the intention of them, is to provide a safety net for US Citizens. When a sanctuary city allows people to essentially benefit from those programs, they're overtaxing an already overtaxed system, and this isn't because we have a lack of compassion for people want to come to this country. I think immigrants make up some of the most loyal citizens you'll ever find because they fled countries and they understand the importance of having rule of law and a government that respects liberty. The problem is that when a town or a municipality is undermining that rule of law there, they're not just creating a fiscally impossible situation. They're also creating a situation which is incredibly unfair, not only US Citizens, but everyone that is trying to come to this country legally. We're telling all those people that are patiently waiting in line that we're going to give priority to someone that jumped ahead of them, and I don't think there's anything fair and compassionate about that I am a strong believer in education reform. If you look at the systems that work from around the world plus all the studies, our system is broken. How much does that have to do with the Teacher's Union blocking any meaningful changes through stuff like eliminating tenure? I think it's interesting. I forget which President of the Teacher's Union it was, I think it was in the eighties, but they asked him, 'Do you care about the students?' and he goes, 'Well, when the students join the union I will care about their interests' I'm paraphrasing, but that was a fairly accurate representation of what he was saying, and I think the problem is a couple of things. It's not just the teachers. It's government monopolization of education. Again, they call it 'universal education,' just like they call it 'universal healthcare.' It's not. It's government. It's a government monopoly over education. Let's imagine the government wanted to help hungry people, and so the government opened up 10,000 government grocery stores and you were assigned a grocery store based off of your address, and when you showed up to the grocery store, you didn't actually select your groceries. They were already determined for you based off of a government caloric index for your family, and the people that worked at the government grocery store were all government employees. None of them were ever rewarded based off of innovation or work ethic or ingenuity or creativity. They were just rewarded based off of seniority. Now imagine that system and ask yourself, 'would that be a good way to feed hungry people? 'I think almost everybody would say, 'Absolutely not. That would be horrible. It wouldn't be good for the employees, and it wouldn't be good for the people. 'I would agree with that, but that's exactly what we did with education. We set up thousands of government schools. We send you to one based off of your address. You have no say in the product that you get. The curriculum is determined for you largely by the government. Teachers are not rewarded based off of creativity or ingenuity. They're rewarded based off of seniority, so why are we surprised that what we all recognize wouldn't work for another critical component of society, which is feeding people, why would we assume that will work for education? I think we need to move toward is a system where dollars follow the students because what you see in that sort of dynamic is a marketplace for education. All of a sudden judging teacher performance is no longer based off of arbitrary standard test scores. Judging student performance is no longer based off of arbitrary government edicts and mandates. All of a sudden students and parents are treated like customers in a situation where different institutions and organizations and teachers are competing for their business. By the same token, teachers would then be rewarded for their creativity and their ingenuity. It's not parents that are concerned about standardized testing. It's politicians, so I think if we had more of a marketplace approach to education, you would get an educational system that would be as diverse as the student population it is seeking to serve. The end result is you would have a situation where parents are more involved. Teachers are more involved in, quite frankly, politicians and bureaucrats would be less involved, which is what we need at this point. The debt is out of control. It seems like it is rising exponentially. What can be done to combat the rising debt? Well, the only way that you can really legitimately combat debt is through spending reform. There's a lot of people say you can raise taxes. The problem with that is that every time you raise taxes, you're taking money out of the hands of the people that earned it, that created that wealth, that created that prosperity. The people that would reinvest that wealth into additional prosperity, additional innovations, services, products, and jobs. Then you're putting it over to the government sector, and the result is always going to be greater waste and greater inefficiency. We need to get spending under control. It doesn't mean that all of the different services that are currently being provided by some government agency would suddenly go away. What it would mean is that instead of that money going through Washington, being run through bureaucracy, and then only a portion of it being sent back that the money will stay in the communities where it originated from in the first place. The end result would be that you'd get a lot more bang for your buck with respect to the spending that would go on through greater economic opportunity within the voluntary sector, which is the private economy. As opposed to going to the coercive sector which is the government. So, you have to get spending under control. We're going to have to attack with entitlement reform. The largest portion of the overall budget really has to do with Medicaid, Medicare, and social security. The thing that we have to realize is the government is not really good at running health insurance. I think they've demonstrated that for several decades now. The government is also not good at managing people's retirement. Especially with social security, the most important thing we have to do is keep our commitment to the people that are dependent upon this program. The people that have paid into it, but we also have to provide future generations with more control, more options over security for their own retirement. I think there's a lot of creative ways that we can do that, that does allow us to honor our commitment. It doesn't put anybody in a bad situation, but it provides options going forward, and that's what we're going to need if we really want to get our spending or budget under control. Would you support overhauling the tax code? Oh, absolutely. The issue that we have right now is that all of the reforms that we've attempted and that we are attempting, and I think the Trump administration did a good job with this last tax reform, is that they all have to operate within the boundaries of the 16th Amendment of the Constitution, which is essentially the federal income tax.So, if we want to see some real reforms within those boundaries, then I think we're going to have to move to a flat tax. But if we could actually amend the 16th amendment, we could move to something like a fair tax, which I think would require a whole lot less resources to implement.You really wouldn't need this huge IRS apparatus, and you could actually collect taxes in a way that I think would be a lot fairer and equitable. Defeating COVID-19, safely reopening the economy and making permanent the temporary regulatory cuts we've seen since the pandemic began are the most important issues facing our district today. If elected, my primary goal from day one will be to find ways that help our local businesses recover from the pandemic and the government-imposed lockdowns that have crippled our economy for the past six months. It's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the largest association of small businesses in America, has endorsed my campaign. COVID-19 has accelerated challenges for families across the commonwealth. How would you grade Congress' work in helping Americans get through the pandemic? Identify some successes and failures.I would rate the House of Representatives' response to COVID-19 to be an abject failure. At a time when the American people are suffering on a scale we scarcely have seen in modern history, Congress has chosen to spend millions bailing out politically connected institutions like the Kennedy Center, while ignoring the people who need help the most.  Throughout this entire pandemic, my opponent has refused to condemn her own party's attempts to use this crisis as a means to allocate more federal spending on its own pet projects, rather than do the serious work of helping our families and businesses navigate their way through these challenging times. I look at serving in Congress the same way I do serving in the Virginia House of Delegates.  If elected, I intend to spend the bulk of my time in my district and with my constituents. Our founders believed government works best when it's closest to the people. Avoiding the ""Beltway Bubble"" mentality that so many other members of Congress have fallen into, my opponent included, is a top priority for me. We will make timely and effective responsiveness to constituent services a top priority. I voted twice to send this constitutional amendment to the people of Virginia for ratification, and I have already voted for it when I cast my ballot early in-person. I believe the voters should choose their politicians, not the other way around. Virtually every critic of this amendment in the General Assembly voted for it in 2019. What changed? The language of the amendment didn't. The only thing that's different in 2020 from 2019 is which party controls the legislature. bashed unemployment insurance and paid sick leave ;A lot of times, we’ll have politicians come forward and want to mandate things like unemployment insurance or mandate paid sick leave. And they look at that as well, we.’re just doing a good thing for a laborer who, you know, shouldn’t come into work anyways, while they’re sick, and especially during COVID, that seems to make sense.

He repeatedly tried to tie the first-term congresswoman to Biden's proposal to raise $3.6 trillion over 10 years through higher taxes on businesses and households earning more than $400,000 a year. ""What's going to happen at the end of the day is that Abigail Spanberger is going to vote to raise your taxes,""  he supports protection of health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions but not through the Affordable Care Act, which has been under attack by Republicans since President Barack Obama signed the law in 2010. ""I don't think the ACA delivered on its promises,"" he said, citing higher insurance premiums and difficulty in finding enough doctors to provide care.  He did not say how he would ensure health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and pay for it without the protection of the health care law, which is the subject of a legal challenge that the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a week after the election.agreed that Russia, Iran and China pose serious threats to the U.S. democratic system, but he also faulted Spanberger for voting to impeach Trump for allegedly using aid to Ukraine to gain political ammunition against Biden  He also accused Democrats of a ""federal takeover"" of local elections by expanding use of mail-in ballots that he said are ""susceptible to fraud.""

With the U.S. Senate poised to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court, abortion also provided a clear distinction between the candidates.  ""I think we need to offer people more options than just abortion,"" Freitas said. Freitas graded the government's response to the public health emergency as ""pretty good,""  Freitas also defended Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization because of its initial response to the emergence of the coronavirus in China. ""I think the WHO demonstrated at the start of the pandemic that they listened far too much to China,"" he said after the forum. Freitas appeared most comfortable talking about his philosophy of limited government, personal freedom, and the need for a strong military. He also focused on what he called the failure of Democratic governors and mayors, to stop violence that erupted during Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. ""They allowed violent protesters to take over peaceful protests,"" he said.",R,0
