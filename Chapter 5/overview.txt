Chapter 5

Each file contains the number of voter agents, voter types and candidate NOMINATE scores 
for that specific VA congressional district for simulating the 2020 U.S. House elections 
under top-two election rules.  

Run each model with BehaviorSpace.  Three available experiments:
	 Results reported for "best parameter combination" in Chapter 4 are from "va0x-10run."
	 Initial single run parameter sweep for all possible parameter combinations, also referred to in Chapter 4, are generated from "cand sweep simple centers."   
	 Also available are "va0x-5run" (5-run repetition of best parameter combinations).
