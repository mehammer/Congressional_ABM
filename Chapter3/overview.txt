Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning: Use RF_SVD_NestedCV.ipynb (Random Forest) and Unreduced_models_NestedCV_final.ipynb (other regression models).  

Validation data and candidate predictions: Use RandomForest_REDUCED_SVD_validation_test.ipynb (Random Forest) and Unreduced_models_validation_test.ipynb (other regression models).  These notebooks generate the validation data and candidate prediction results referred to in 3.3 of the dissertation.  

These notebooks require the training dataset, 116incCR1.txt (validation data), 116cand.csv (candidate data),  and congress_stopwords.py.  See README.pdf for instructions for training data.
